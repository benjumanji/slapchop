SLAP CHOP
=========

It slices, it dices!

This is my own (soon to be) ultimate rofi mode.

Goals
-----

Interactive drill down. I hate switching "modes" I'd rather type the "mode" and drill into it by pressing enter. I've tried combi and I don't like that either. Unfortunately that means reimplimenting all the existing modes so that I can have them work the way I want them too.

Hopefully I can at least make them both "drill down" and work like regular rofi modes.


1. Nice pass mode that allows me to copy to either xsel or clip. password / username.
2. Pass mode that allows me to autofill by tracking the last window that was in focus and using xdo, probably via i3 rpc.
3. Nice ssh mode that parses ssh\_config.
4. Nice window switcher.
5. Nice runner.
